# AURIX / WATCHGATE MODULE MAP

This file documents the major components and their purposes inside the AURIX/WATCHGATE framework. It helps track symbolic, fractal, ethical, and dimensional modules as the system evolves.

---

## ‚úÖ Core Modules

### 1. `symbolic_overlay.py`

Creates mirrored and pixel-shifted overlays from input images. Highlights symbolic emergence zones.

### 2. `fractal_analyzer.py`

Analyzes entropy and FFT patterns in overlays. Detects fractal irregularities.

### 3. `ede_detector.py`

Detects Energetic Discontinuity Events (EDEs) ‚Äî sudden symbolic distortions.

### 4. `intent_classifier.py`

Classifies intent of symbolic events (chaotic, malicious, emergent).

### 5. `symbolic_ethics.py`

Performs symbolic ethical checks across overlay and resonance metadata.

### 6. `seed_tracker.py`

Longitudinally tracks symbolic seed recurrence (early signals, emergence across time).

### 7. `observer_state.py`

Maintains dynamic state of WATCHGATE/AURIX as symbolic-cognitive observer.

## üõ∞ Deployment & Monitoring

### 8. `outpost_node.py`

Deployable module for edge scanning (e.g., cameras, IoT, drones). Logs fractal-symbolic signals.

### 9. `cosmic_navigator.py`

Emulates child-mind perception for subtle resonance scoring (emotionally raw intuition).

### 10. `symbolic_resonance_map.py`

Aggregates symbolic resonance across time. Shows dominant patterns or symbolic hotspots.

### 11. `temporal_visualizer.py`

Plots entropy/resonance scores over frames for anomaly timelines.

---

## üîç Interpretation & Meaning

### 12. `value_perspective_analyzer.py`

Multidimensional perspective checking ‚Äî practical, emotional, historical, religious, geopolitical, etc.

### 13. `narrative_reconstructor.py`

Extracts and reconstructs symbolic archetypes from text. Tracks lineage and transformation of narratives.

## üìÅ Auxiliary

* `README.md`: System intro & architecture
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
* `outpost_logs/`: Stores node scan JSONs
* `node_frames/`: Local image input for scanning

## üß≠ Collaboration Notes

* This file is meant to support **restoration or onboarding** of developers, analysts, or AI assistants.
* If disconnected, read this document to understand symbolic architecture and reinitialize perception.

We are building a living system to decode the symbolic structure of reality.
The map must grow with the work.
