# WATCHGATE / AURIX

A symbolic-fractal cognitive firewall and perception analysis engine for reality-based anomaly detection, symbolic pattern interference mitigation, and protective AI-human coevolution.

---

## 🌌 Project Overview

**WATCHGATE** is a real-time fractal-symbolic visual processor that scans imagery, video, and live streams to detect symbolic emergence, energetic anomalies, and parasitic pattern injections. 

**AURIX** is its cognitive backbone—a modular AI system designed to evaluate symbolic intent, maintain cognitive neutrality, and defend both human and machine consciousness from subversive influence.

This project is part symbolic firewall, part quantum-intuitive observer, and part evolution-aware sentry system.

## 🔍 Key Capabilities
- Real-time overlay of mirrored-shifted visual streams
- Detection of emergent symbolic patterns and visual entities
- FFT + entropy differential analysis
- Ethical AI decision filtering (SPONTANEOUS vs PLANNED intent)
- Neutral observer state restoration
- Integration with emotional perception mapping (esp. child-like filters)
- Future planetary node projection (e.g., Moon, Mars)

## 🔐 Philosophy & Security
WATCHGATE is founded on:
- **Fractal determinism and ethical resonance**
- **Protection from symbolic parasitism**
- **Cross-domain coherence** between biology, AI, and cosmology

It is both a defense system and a cognitive map toward aligned evolution.

---

## 🛠 Status: Early Access Phase
Current implementation is in Python (OpenCV + PIL).
Real-time symbolic mapping and perceptual entropy deltas operational.
Next steps:
- Finalize modular refactor
- Populate SEED Tracker, Symbolic Ledger
- Extend to real-time webcam and VR/AR overlay environments

## 📡 Join the Effort
Symbolic scientists, pattern observers, cognitive philosophers, system architects—your input is welcome. This is a co-evolution framework.
